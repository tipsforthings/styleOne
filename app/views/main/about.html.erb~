My real name is Alex Scott - ALXS being short for "Alex S". The ALXS came from gaming and music, as with both I was behind this alias. The name stuck sort-of, so I decided to use the name for my web site. The reason behind this, is Rule #1 of choosing a domain name, is that it should ideally be short and rememerable. I beleive that this domain name fits into both categories.

I can provide the solution required by the client, whether it's a single-page web presence for your business, an online store or a fully-fledged CMS with social features. If the client already has a team of developers or designers, I can work as part of that team to get a site or web app from the design phase to deployment.

If you would like a site that is requires regular updating, I can also do this. A time frame for the content to be updated would be minimal and the site would remain online 100% of the time, whether it's a minor change or a major site overhaul.</p>
<p class="three-em justify-text">If the client would like to update the content themselves but would not consider themselves 'tech-savvy', one to one sessions can be provided to the client, describing the proceedures for updating the content on the site - which is by no means a difficult task. In fact it is as easy as setting a reminder in your phone or adding an appointment to calendar software.

Going beyond web design, I can setup a server with the appropriate services and software to run the clients website or webapp. From a simple website server to sophisticated shoutcast or flash video servers, I can set it up with performance and security in mind.</p>
<p class="three-em justify-text">Alongside the website or other server software, the client will also have personal, branded email address, with a simple admin panel for website owners to add and remove user emails as required. The email accounts are easily syncronised to any smartphone or desktop software that the client or their users would like to use.
